libdesktopenvironments
======================

This little library attempts to make it easier for GUI programs to create a
native experience on any desktop environment.

Many GUI frameworks have similar methods, but when trying to use something
basic, like e.g. FTLK, the functionality is often missing. These are the
cases when this library can be used.

libdesktopenvironments is written in C++98 and does not have any
dependencies but the standard library, which means it is really, really
portable.

This project was heavily inspired by
[ScreenFetch](https://github.com/KittyKatt/screenFetch/)'s desktop
environment detection code.
